	-Connect ADF via USB. 
	-Run Xloader.exe 
	-Click "Hex File" selection button. 
	-Find the correct .hex file.
	-Select device as Duemilanove/Nano(ATmega328).
	-Com port is the USB port which the ADF Panel is connected. 
	-Check baud rate is 57600 and then upload the hex file. 
	
Important Note: While uploading, never interrupt the communication of the ATC. Otherwise, there is no way to recover if damaged.
